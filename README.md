# Advent of Code 2022
### By Tomish

I don't really do these challenges to find the fast, the shortest of the more efficents way to solve them. But I do them to train myself with daily algorithms challenges. 
I'm by far, not an expert but I enjoy algorithm a lot ! So this repo, which I don't even think one day will contain all the challenges solved, is for me a milestone of my progression using Python.

Some challenge will be solved using a really dirty and not performing methods and loops, but at the end, as far i have the good result, it's fine 🎄 ! 

## Challenge recap :

| Day | Part|  Status | Processing time | Personnal Difficulty Writing | Comment |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| ---- |
| 1 | Part 1 | Solved | 0.0009s | ⭐☆☆☆☆| --- | 
| 1 | Part 2 | Solved | 0.0010s | ⭐☆☆☆☆| --- | 
| 2 | Part 1 | Solved | 0.0020s | ⭐☆☆☆☆ | IF EVERY WHERE (i also don't know the rules of Rock paper cisors lel) |
| 2 | Part 2 | Solved | 0.0010s | ⭐☆☆☆☆ | Faster than the part 1, it means that my script is reaaaaly dirty
| 3 | Part 1 | Solved | 0.0020s | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | I didn't know the intersect function.. so doing it with loop wasn't succesful
| 3 | Part 2 | Solved | 0.0020s | ⭐☆☆☆☆ | It's easier with the intersect function 😄
| 4 | Part 1 | Solved | 0.0009s | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | I didn't take time to for my var to int.. I lose a lot of time on this error !
| 4 | Part 2 | Solved | 0.0021s | ⭐☆☆☆☆ | A paper sheet and a pen.... solved is less than 5 minutes !
| 5 | Part 1 | Solved | 0.0021s | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | For me, manipulating arrays is always weird.. But after some tests, it was really easy to do this clear exercice !
| 5 | Part 2 | Solved | 0.0008s | ☆☆☆☆☆ | Just needed to remove the "reverse" part from the first part, really easy, i'm proud of my code, which this time isn't sponsored by Barilla
